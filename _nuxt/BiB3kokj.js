Refund Conditions and Time Limits</h3><p data-v-9afb62a3> Users may apply for refunds under the following circumstances, with core rules aligned with general digital product industry standards and consumer protection principles: </p><h4 data-v-9afb62a3>2.1 7-Day Unconditional Right of Cancellation</h4><ul data-v-9afb62a3><li data-v-9afb62a3> For One-time Services: Consumers have the right to cancel their purchase and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 7 days from the transaction completion date, provided that core functions have not been fully utilized; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> For Subscription Services: Applicable only to initial subscriptions (excluding automatic renewals). Consumers have the right to cancel their subscription and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 7 days from the initial transaction completion date. If the service has been partially used, the refund amount will be calculated based on the proportion of unused days of the cycle. </li></ul><p data-v-9afb62a3> Note: Automatic renewals of subscription services are not eligible for the 7-day unconditional refund right, which applies solely to initial subscriptions. </p><h4 data-v-9afb62a3>2.2 Time Limit Calculation Rules</h4><ul data-v-9afb62a3><li data-v-9afb62a3> Start time: The 7-day period commences on the day after the transaction completion date (based on the payment confirmation timestamp, not the date of actual service use); </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> Validity of the period: The cancellation notice is deemed valid if sent before the 7-day period expires, regardless of the date we receive it.

After verification, we will refund the corresponding fee based on the period affected by the product fault; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> False or misleading promotion: If the actual service content is inconsistent with the promotion description (e.g., advertised features are not provided), users may apply for a full refund regardless of usage status; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> Duplicate purchase/activation errors: If users repeatedly purchase the same One-time Service or activate the same Subscription Service due to operational errors, they must apply for a refund within 3 days from the date of the duplicate transaction.
