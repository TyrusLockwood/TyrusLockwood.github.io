Special Provisions for Subscription Services (Alignment with Paddle Rules) </h3><ul data-v-31b2b1f1><li data-v-31b2b1f1> The subscription service is based on a monthly/annual cycle (you may select an annual cycle for a discount, if available; the specific cycle is subject to the package displayed at the time of purchase) and is set to auto-renew by default until the user actively cancels it. <br data-v-31b2b1f1><strong data-v-31b2b1f1>⚠️ Note: Automatic renewals are not eligible for the 14-day unconditional refund right.</strong></li><li data-v-31b2b1f1> If the subscription price is adjusted, we will notify the user via in-extension prompts or the email associated with the Paddle order at least 7 natural days in advance. If the user disagrees with the price adjustment, they may cancel the subscription before the end of the current cycle; the price adjustment will not affect the already active subscription cycle. </li><li data-v-31b2b1f1> The subscription renewal deduction time is between 00:00 and 01:00 (UTC) on the expiration date of each subscription cycle. </li><li data-v-31b2b1f1> To cancel the subscription, the user shall complete two steps at least 48 hours before the end of the current subscription cycle: <ul data-v-31b2b1f1><li data-v-31b2b1f1> Submit a &quot;cancel automatic renewal&quot; application through official Paddle channels (to ensure Paddle stops subsequent deductions); </li><li data-v-31b2b1f1> Synchronize the cancellation notice through our email (tyruslockwood@gmail.com) with Paddle order number and purchase email attached. </li></ul> The cancellation will take effect in the next cycle, and the already paid fee for the current cycle will not be refunded.
