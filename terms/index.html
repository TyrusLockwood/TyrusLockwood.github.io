Refund Conditions and Time Limits</h3><p data-v-9afb62a3> Users may apply for refunds under the following circumstances, with core rules aligned with general digital product industry standards and consumer protection principles: </p><h4 data-v-9afb62a3>2.1 7-Day Unconditional Right of Cancellation</h4><ul data-v-9afb62a3><li data-v-9afb62a3> For One-time Services: Consumers have the right to cancel their purchase and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 7 days from the transaction completion date, provided that core functions have not been fully utilized; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> For Subscription Services: Applicable only to initial subscriptions (excluding automatic renewals). Consumers have the right to cancel their subscription and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 7 days from the initial transaction completion date. If the service has been partially used, the refund amount will be calculated based on the proportion of unused days of the cycle. </li></ul><p data-v-9afb62a3> Note: Automatic renewals of subscription services are not eligible for the 7-day unconditional refund right, which applies solely to initial subscriptions. </p><h4 data-v-9afb62a3>2.2 Time Limit Calculation Rules</h4><ul data-v-9afb62a3><li data-v-9afb62a3> Start time: The 7-day period commences on the day after the transaction completion date (based on the payment confirmation timestamp, not the date of actual service use); </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> Validity of the period: The cancellation notice is deemed valid if sent before the 7-day period expires, regardless of the date we receive it. This ensures users&#39; legitimate exercise of the refund right. </li></ul><h4 data-v-9afb62a3>2.3 Supplementary Refund Scenarios</h4><p data-v-9afb62a3> In addition to the 7-day unconditional right of cancellation mentioned above, consumers may apply for refunds within the following specific time limits (if the time limit is shorter than 7 days, the following provisions shall apply; uncovered scenarios shall still be subject to the 7-day rule in Section 2.1): </p><ul data-v-9afb62a3><li data-v-9afb62a3> Service quality issues: If One-time Services/Subscription Services (including initial and renewal periods) cannot be used normally due to product quality defects (e.g., failure to load features, core functions not working as described), users may apply for a refund within 7 days from the date of discovering the problem. After verification, we will refund the corresponding fee based on the period affected by the product fault; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> False or misleading promotion: If the actual service content is inconsistent with the promotion description (e.g., advertised features are not provided), users may apply for a full refund regardless of usage status; </li><li data-v-9afb62a3> Duplicate purchase/activation errors: If users repeatedly purchase the same One-time Service or activate the same Subscription Service due to operational errors, they must apply for a refund within 3 days from the date of the duplicate transaction. After verifying the transaction records, we will refund the repeatedly paid amount. </li></ul><h3 data-v-9afb62a3>3.
