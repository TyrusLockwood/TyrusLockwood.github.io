Refund Conditions and Time Limits</h3><p data-v-d7ed3cc2> Users may apply for refunds under the following circumstances, with core refund periods and rules strictly following Paddle&#39;s 14-day right of cancellation policy: </p><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2> 2.1 14-Day Unconditional Right of Cancellation (Fully compliant with Paddle&#39;s Buyer Terms) </h4><ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> For <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>One-time Services</strong>: Consumers have the right to cancel their purchase and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 14 days from the day after completing the transaction through Paddle; </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> For <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Subscription Services</strong>: Applicable only to <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>initial subscriptions</strong> (excluding automatic renewals). Consumers have the right to cancel their subscription and apply for a full refund without providing any reason within 14 days from the day after completing the initial subscription transaction through Paddle (if the service has been partially used, the refund amount will be calculated based on the &quot;proportion of unused days&quot;); </li></ul><p data-v-d7ed3cc2><i data-v-d7ed3cc2>Note: In accordance with Paddle&#39;s Buyer Terms, the &quot;automatic renewal&quot; of subscription services is not eligible for this 14-day unconditional right of cancellation, which applies only to initial subscriptions.</i></p><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2> 2.2 Time Limit Calculation Rules (Fully consistent with Paddle&#39;s Terms) </h4><ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Start time: The 14-day period begins on the day after the &quot;transaction completion date&quot; displayed on the Paddle platform (not the date when the user actually uses the service); </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Validity of the period: As long as the consumer sends the cancellation notice before the expiration of the 14-day period (regardless of when we or Paddle receive it), it is considered to meet the deadline requirements and does not affect the exercise of the right of cancellation. </li></ul><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2>2.3 Supplementary Refund Scenarios</h4><p data-v-d7ed3cc2> In addition to the 14-day unconditional right of cancellation mentioned above, consumers may apply for refunds within the following specific time limits (if the time limit is shorter than 14 days, the following provisions shall apply; uncovered scenarios shall still be subject to the 14-day rule in Section 2.1): </p><ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2><strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Service quality issues</strong>: If One-time Services/Subscription Services (including initial and renewal periods) cannot be used normally due to quality issues with our products (e.g., inability to load features, failure of core benefits), consumers must apply for a refund within 7 days from the day after the problem occurs. After verification, we will refund the corresponding fee based on the &quot;fault impact period&quot;; </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2><strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Duplicate purchase/activation errors</strong>: If consumers repeatedly purchase the same One-time Service or activate the same Subscription Service due to operational errors, they must apply for a refund within 3 days from the day after the duplicate transaction is completed.

Refund Application Process</h3><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2> 3.1 Submission of Cancellation Notice (Strictly following Paddle&#39;s requirements) </h4><p data-v-d7ed3cc2> In accordance with Paddle&#39;s Buyer Terms, consumers <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>must first inform Paddle</strong> when exercising their right of cancellation, following these procedures: </p><ol data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2><strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Primary step</strong>: Consumers must submit a cancellation notice through <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>official Paddle channels</strong>: <ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Paddle &quot;<a href="https://paddle.net/" target="_blank" data-v-d7ed3cc2>Contact Us</a>&quot; online form (recommended channel for immediate processing); </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2>Or use Paddle&#39;s provided model cancellation form;</li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Or issue a clear, unambiguous cancellation statement through other communication channels recognized by Paddle. </li></ul></li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2><strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Content requirements for notice</strong>: <ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Must include: Paddle order number, name of purchased service, consumer&#39;s name and contact information; </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> When using the model cancellation form, complete information is required: order date, consumer&#39;s address, and if submitting in paper form, consumer&#39;s signature and date. </li></ul></li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2><strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>Simultaneously inform us</strong>: After submitting the cancellation notice to Paddle, please synchronize relevant information through our email:<br data-v-d7ed3cc2>Email: tyruslockwood@gmail.com<br data-v-d7ed3cc2>(Please provide a screenshot or receipt of Paddle&#39;s notice to facilitate our assistance in processing) </li></ol><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2>3.2 Confirmation and Review</h4><ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Paddle will send an acknowledgment of receipt immediately upon receiving the cancellation notice (if submitted through the &quot;<a href="https://paddle.net/" target="_blank" data-v-d7ed3cc2>Contact Us</a>&quot; form); </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Upon receiving the user&#39;s synchronized application, we will verify the order and cancellation notice records with Paddle and complete the review within 3 working days; </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> The review result will be notified via the user&#39;s reserved email: <ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Approved: Simultaneously inform the refund progress and Paddle&#39;s refund processing channel; </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Rejected: Clearly explain the reasons (e.g., missing materials, overdue, non-compliance with Paddle rules, etc.) and inform the method for supplementary materials. </li></ul></li></ul><h4 data-v-d7ed3cc2>3.3 Processing Priority</h4><p data-v-d7ed3cc2> If a consumer qualifies for both &quot;14-day unconditional cancellation&quot; and &quot;supplementary refund scenarios&quot; simultaneously, the &quot;14-day unconditional cancellation&quot; process will take priority to ensure compliance with Paddle&#39;s rules. </p><h3 data-v-d7ed3cc2>4. Refund Method</h3><ul data-v-d7ed3cc2><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Refund path: Strictly following Paddle&#39;s fund flow, all refunds will be processed through the <strong data-v-d7ed3cc2>user&#39;s original payment method</strong> (i.e., the account used by the user to pay through Paddle); </li><li data-v-d7ed3cc2> Arrival time: The time for refund funds to arrive depends on the processing cycle of Paddle platform and the user&#39;s payment channel (usually 3-10 working days).
